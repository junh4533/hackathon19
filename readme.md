<h1>reFashion - CUNY hackathon 2019</h1>

<strong>Go green, save green. </strong>

<p>Our mission is to improve waste management through recycling old clothes. We can incentivize users to 
donate their old clothes by offering coupons for major retailers like H&M, Urban Outfitters, etc.
Our web application, reFashion, uses a point based system to reward users for their contributions. 
For each ounce of clothes that they donate, they get 10 points. They can then redeem those points for coupons.</p>
